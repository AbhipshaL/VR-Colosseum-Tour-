# VR-Colosseum-Tour-
An interactive 3D tour of the Colosseum that brings Ancient Rome to life through computer graphics and immersive design. This project was developed using OpenGL and Unity as part of a Computer Graphics assignment, with the goal of combining education and exploration in a virtual environment.


**Features**

3D Navigation – Move through the Colosseum, from the arena floor to the seating tiers
Architectural Details – Explore realistic models, textures, and lighting that simulate the ancient amphitheater
Interactive Learning – Hotspots provide historical and cultural context
Immersive Experience – Designed to mimic the scale and atmosphere of the original structure

**Tech Stack**

OpenGL – Low-level rendering and graphics programming
Unity – For building the interactive VR/3D experience
C# / C++ – Core implementation and interactivity
Blender / 3D Assets – For modeling and texturing the Colosseum

**Purpose**

The project demonstrates how computer graphics and immersive technologies can be used for educational storytelling, allowing users to experience history in a more engaging and interactive way.
